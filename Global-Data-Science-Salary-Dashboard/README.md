# Job Market & Salary Analysis Dashboard (India + Global)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes job market trends and salary insights for Data Science roles across India and the Globe. The goal is to identify key factors influencing salaries, such as experience, job role, and location, and to create a Power BI dashboard for visualization.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze specific salary trends in India vs. the rest of the world.
- Understand the impact of remote work on salaries.
- Identify top-paying skills and roles.
- Prepare a clean, Power BI-ready dataset.
